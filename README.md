# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY
 Lending club wants to identify “risky” loan applicants who are unlikely to pay loan back. These applicants are called as "defaulters"

Lending club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  

The dataset has the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
